# Introduction

## Hey there! 🎉

Hi, my name is **Xuefei Luan**, but you can call me **Sophie**—because let's be honest, it’s way easier to pronounce when you're in a rush! 😆 I’m from **China** and currently diving deep into the world of **Computer Graphics and Music Programming**.

## What I Love ❤️
- 🎨 Art: Whether it’s digital, traditional, or just doodling in the margins of my notes, I love it all!
- 🎵 Music: If life had a soundtrack, mine would be an unpredictable mix of everything from classical to electronic beats.
- 💻 Coding: I’m basically making computers dance to my code—literally, with music programming!

## Fun Fact 🤓
I spend so much time staring at my screen that I’m convinced my eyes are slowly evolving into RGB pixels. 🖥️🌈
